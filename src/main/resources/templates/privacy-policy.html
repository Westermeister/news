                <p>
                    We are the creators of this website, and we will collectively call ourselves "The Authors" in
                    this Privacy Policy. Currently, we consist of only a single
                    individual, who goes by the pseudonym "Westermeister", and who has the
                    following email address:
                    <a href="mailto:westermeister12@gmail.com" rel="author">westermeister12@gmail.com</a>.
                    You can contact this email address for any questions or requests.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout this Privacy Policy we'll refer to our websites and other
                    products and services collectively as "Services." This Privacy Policy will
                    explain how we collect, use, and share information about you, along with the choices that
                    you have with respect to that information.

                <h2 class="mb-3">Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>
                    We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so â€” for example, to provide our
                    Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect this information
                    from two sources: if and when you provide information to us, and automatically through operating
                    our Services. Let's go over the information that we collect.

                        When you sign up for an account, you provide your full name, your email address, and a password.
                        All of these items are collected and stored by us.

                            up for an account, as well as the date and time of your most recent sign-in.

                            website each time the visitor returns. We use cookies to help us identify and keep track
                            of visitors and usage, as well as to access preferences for our Services.

                <p>
                    We use information about you for the purposes listed below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To provide our Services.</strong>
                        For example, to set up and maintain your account, provide customer service, and verify user
                        credentials.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To ensure quality, maintain safety, and improve our Services.</strong>
                        For example, by providing automatic upgrades and new versions of our Services.
                        Or, for example, by monitoring and analyzing how users interact with our Services
                        so we can create new features that we think our users will enjoy and that will help
                        them create and manage websites more efficiently or make our Services easier to use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To protect our Services, our users, and the public.</strong>
                        For example, by detecting security incidents; detecting and protecting against malicious,
                        deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity; fighting spam; complying with our legal
                        obligations; and protecting the rights and property of The Authors and others, which may
                        result in us, for example, terminating Services.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong>
                        For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To customize the user experience.</strong>
                        For example, to personalize your experience by adjusting your account preferences.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>To communicate with you.</strong>
                        For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, or to notify you of changes to our
                        Services.

                <p>
                    We generally discard information about you when it's no longer needed for the purposes for which we
                    collect and use it, and we're not legally required to keep it.
                </p>

                    For example, we keep information about your account, such as your name, email, and password, for as
                    long as your account exists. If you close your account, we will no longer keep that information.

                <p>
                    While no online service is 100% secure, we will take reasonable measures to protect information
                    about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction.

                        our website, with the drawback that certain features may not work properly without the aid
                        of cookies.

                        as described in How Long We Keep Information above - for example, when that information is
