# Overview

Many of us have busy lives, including things like school, work, errands, and more. Staying in the loop, oftentimes,
just isn't high enough of a priority. That's why I made this web app, which reduces the news from a cluttered mess
of sensationalist headlines into a simple list of facts for the day.

This project was inspired by a [similar project](https://github.com/Westermeister/journalight-original) that I coded
a few years earlier, using TypeScript and Python.
